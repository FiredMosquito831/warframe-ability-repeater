# warframe-ability-repeater
A simple python script with GUI using tkinter for automatically spamming abilities

# Usage
#### Select the abilities you want to use (1, 2, 3, 4) by ticking the boxes


#### Set a hotkey (i personally use 6)

#### Choose the delay for each ability in seconds

#### Update the delays

#### Press on start script, after that the script will be active

#### While in game press the hotkey to start the loop or pause, whenever the loop gets unpaused it will activate all the chosen abilities for convenience

# TO BE ADDED:

- Prevent AFK farming by detecting lack of input in movement keys such as WASD (after 5 minutes the script will turn itself off).
- Add a variable delay between each sequential ability (same ability) activation, between 1 and 3 seconds.
- Add customizable delay between different key presses when activating 2â€“4 abilities at the same time to prevent issues of input not registering (certain abilities take time to cast, during which no others can be activated, such as GAUSS REDLINE).
